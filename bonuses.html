		<h1>General Note</h1>
		These bonuses are intended to be temporary boons, which help losing players come back and reverse the runaway trajectory of the campaign. I reserve the right to make balance changes to buff/nerf some bonuses as needed throughout the campaign.

		<h1>Basic Rules</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Once you've been matched with an opponent, but before Selecting a Mission to play, count the number of territories that you and your opponent control.</li>
			<li>If you control fewer territories than your opponent, select a number of bonuses equal to the difference in controlled territories between you and your opponent. The bonuses are selected from the territories that you own, or from the bonus table below.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>For example: Player A controls 3 territories, and Player B controls 5 territories. Player A chooses 1 bonus from the table below, and 1 from a territory that he owns.
			</ul>
			<li>Any Bonus Selections must be used in the upcoming game. If they are not used by the end of the game, they are lost.</li>
			<li>You must disclose any Bonus Selections to your opponent before the start of the game.</li>
			<li>Some bonuses will require the Player to own certain territories in order to activate.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Example: The orbital bombardment requires the Player to control the Orbital Shipyard.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h1>Bonus Types</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Territory Bonuses may only be selected if you currently control the corresponding territory, located on the map.</li>
			<li>For example, the Orbital Bombardment bonus requires the player to control the Baphomet Prime Sector 2.</li>
			<li>Tactical Bonuses may be selected by any player, regardless of territory control.</li>
			<li>No bonus may be selected more than once.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
