		<h1>Initial Set-up</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>There are four habitable planets in the Baphomet system.</li>
			<li>Each planet has four territories.</li>
			<li>All territories are neutral (unaffiliated with any Player).</li>
			<li>Territory control will be tracked on a war map, with Players pinning their army's flag to their newly claimed territory.</li>
			<li>Each Player builds a 250 point army.</li>
			<li>At the 250 and 325 point brackets, an HQ choice is considered optional. This is the only FOC modification, and was designed with the intent to allow Players some more wiggle room in building a functional army at such low points values.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Monthly Games</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Each Player is matched up against one other Player per month. Starting with the Player controlling the fewest territories, each Player selects an opponent.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Roll off if multiple Players tie for the fewest territories.</li>
				<li>Players may not play against the same opponent two games in a row.</li>
				<li>If you control fewer territories than your opponent, select a number of bonuses on the bonus chart equal to the difference in territory count.</li>
				<li>For example, if Player A has 8 territories, and Player B has 4 territories, Player B receives 4 Bonus Table selections.</li>
			</ul>

			<li>The winner of the battle now selects a territory to invade.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If neutral territories remain on the war map, the winner may choose to invade a neutral territory, or a territory from the loser of the battle.</li>
				<li>An invaded territory is no longer controlled by the invaded Player, and instead becomes controlled by the winning Player.</li>
				<li>If the invaded Player controls no territory, and no neutral territory is available, no territory is gained.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<li>After all Players have played their games for the month, every Player's army size increases by 125 points.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Bonus Table</h1>
			<ul>
				See the <a href="bonuses.html">Relics</a> section.
			</ul>
		
		<h1>Determining a Winner</h1>
		<ul>
			<li> After all the games have been played (12 months), count up all Territories owned by each Player.</li>
			<ul>
				<li> For each territory controlled by a Player, the Player scores 1 point for himself, and 1 point for his Faction.</li>
				<li> For each entire planet controlled by a Player, the Player scores 3 points for himself, and 3 points for his Faction.</li>
			</ul>

			<li> The Player with the most points is the Overall Winner.</li>
			<li> The Faction with the most points is the Faction Winner.</li>
		</ul>
