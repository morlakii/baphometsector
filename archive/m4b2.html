		<p>The Black Templars were securing their garrisons on Gnost when Waaagh! Krall krooz'd through their territory in their souped-up Trukks and a Wagon load of Burna Boyz.</p>
		<p>The patrolling scouts in the area knew their sniper rifles would prove ineffectual against the heavy armor and the Orks' superior numbers. They called in heavy support, and got a response from their Master of the Forge. He brought his personal Land Raider Redeemer, well suited for dealing with Orks.</p>
		<p>In the end, the flamestorm cannons ignited the burna boyz' promethium tanks, and burned to the Orks to ashes, resulting in a completely secured planet for the Black Templars.</p>
