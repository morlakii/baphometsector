		<p>The surface of Mithras sprawled out in an endless horizon of ice, craters and petrified carrion. A single unit of Pathfinders hurried across the ichor and blue blood stained surface while combing the recent battle in the NW quadrant of the planet. Expedition was simple. Investigate and discover why communications with La'rua Shadowsun of the O'prah's 4th Sphere Expansion Force have gone silent. With the disappearance of the La'rua, discovering the answer to the loss of one-third control over Mithras was critical.<br><br>Survivors of the battle wove stories of Y'he, The Great Devourer. Scanning the area confirmed this was true, but the enemy was nowhere to be found.  A brief burst of static cut the silence, "Shas'ui B'kak, come to my coordinates immediately. It..." The sound of vomit filled the team's shared communication tether.<br><br>"M'yen," whispered B'kak. He approached the mystery, dropped his rifle and fell to his knees. His team gathered behind him. In front of them at the edge of a cliff, stood an arced biological construct of Y'he.  Tangled within the center of the arc was Aun Shadowsun himself. His arms and legs torn from their sockets, each replaced by a tentacle tethered to the arc. The husk almost seemed to hover in front of them. As Shas'ui wept silently, the Aun's lifeless husk sprung to action. Beams of light shot from the eye sockets, as its neck was broken backwards to face the sky. The sound of shattering glass pummeled the eardrums of the Pathfinder squad. At first the sounds seemed to echo every known language in the universe at once, including some strange dialects. The voice that was speaking was not projected physically; it came from deep within the mind. As it spoke, all languages slowly melted into Tau'sia.<br> <br>July 2014.999.M41 the skies began to grow dark and move as one giant mass. La'rua Shadowsun summoned all available units in the area to take up residence in a ruined city. Just as the force assembled, Y'he was all around us. A carnifex led by a swarm of scythe-armed hormagaunts suddenly appeared behind our gun line as the enemy approached in mass from the front. On high the mental shrieks rippled through our collective minds, heralding the arrival of the Flying Hive Tyrant.<br>             <br>As we readied our armaments, Y'he opened fire from all angles. It was a firefight. XV104 returned fire on the hormagaunts as the carnifex mindlessly stomped forward. Damage was done to the battle suit, but attention was immediately turned toward the hellfire raining down on the Sky Ray. Holes appeared throughout the hull. Immobilized but still functional, the Sky Ray aimed and unleashed its entire missile array cache upon the winged terror. We stood in awe as the beast evaded and resisted every single missile. Turning focus to the horde in front of us, several hormagaunt units were leveled by the might of Tau firepower.<br> <br>A rush of air was all I felt as the screams of my beloved fire warriors echoed out from all around me. One by one they fell, taking with them a slithering hell beast that ate into their chest cavity and burrowed out of site. The worm devils were all around my feet. I began stomping each of them to oblivion while screeching orders to return fire into the Tyrant. Success! The demon fell from the sky and was grounded nearby. As it stood and turned its mass toward us, I bellowed the words of our ancients. Then darkness overcame as a mass of slithering death washed over me. My pride was cut short. The battle was lost. Y'he Or'es."<br><br>As the shrieks bouncing off the inner walls of their skulls subsided, the Pathfinder squadron stood in stunned silence. Before they could collect their thoughts, the ground trembled and split open beneath their feet. The Aun's Arc rose into the sky revealing a massive hole. The glimmer of a thousand tiny eyes glinted back from the darkness. </p>
