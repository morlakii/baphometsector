		<p>High above the desolate windswept plains of planet Gnost, a terrifying monstrosity silently plies the skies surveying the landscape below. Observing through his eyes, the implacable Hive Mind guides him to the site of the next Tyranid action. A surprise attack conceived by a superhuman cunning, to be executed with devastating exactness and unparalleled timing. Each component moving as one in a beautiful and macabre waltz of destruction. <br><br>  Though carefully calculated to be a decisive blow against the soft pink creatures currently controlling the rocky orb, the Hive has chosen, peculiarly, to conserve its limited biomass by not simply overrunning the planet with swarm upon swarm of ravenous predators. Opting instead to establish a foothold and whittle the enemy down bit by bit. A rare war of attrition.     <br><br>  The Baphomet Sector has proven uniquely problematic for the omnipotent Will Of The Hive. The sheer number of combatants, the unpredictability of their maneuvers, has called for some unorthodox solutions. Not the least of which includes converging two separate tendrils of the indomitable race into the same solar system simultaneously. An unprecedented and potentially perilous tactic. If, for whatever reason, the psychic connection with one or both factions should be lost, they might very well destroy one another. A risk The Hive is perfectly willing to incur.<br><br>  This is, of course, no concern to the voracious Hive Tyrant as he glides gracefully toward his target, massive leathery wings beating the frigid air into submission. Far below, he sees the others are already in position. More than that, he feels their presence through the use of incredibly sensitive organs in his brain, capable of transmitting and receiving even the most minute of psychic vibrations. It is these very organs that cause him to shriek in pain as a massive psychic shockwave sends torrents of disruptive energy rippling through his body. For fractions of a second, the connection to his omnipresent overlord is broken. He twists and writhes in the air nearly falling from the sky. Though the episode is over in an instant, a curious invisible force now permeates the planet. Like a mental itch, impossible to scratch. Something significant just happened in the center of the system. <br><br>  The Hive Mind notes the anomaly and returns the Tyrant's attention to the task at hand. High above the desolate windswept plains of Gnost, a nightmarish alien monster prepares to swoop on it's unsuspecting prey...<br><br>  Far away on a distant planet's surface a small detachment of ferocious warriors maintain a tenuous grasp on a tiny sliver of battered land. Surrounded on all sides, assailed by every threat humanly conceivable, it is a waning bastion of the glorious Imperium. A hallowed oasis in a sea of chaotic despair. <br><br>  The citizens of this failing hamlet enjoyed centuries of peace before the enigmatic fates saw fit to dash their hopes to pieces. An unfortunate harmony of coincidence concatenating into a living hell worthy of Dante's wildest imaginations. <br><br>  It was into this boiling cauldron of turmoil that a man had been thrust, against his better judgment, to investigate a matter of dire importance. He was Inquisitor Venator of the Caesis Signatum. As an outsider of this backwater habitation the customs here seemed strange to him. The inhabitants even more so. Before him was Sgt. Marbo, a perfect example of a people too long isolated from the collective progress of humanity. They sat opposite one another in a nearly empty room on hard wooden chairs bathed in harsh florescent light. The setting was intended to make "guests" uncomfortable. Marbo however seemed all too complacent as he waited patiently, hands folded neatly on the table in front of him, for the Grand Inquisitor to speak. <br><br>  Venator had been grilling him for nearly an hour and felt they were at an impasse. There was clearly something off about the man, just not enough strong evidence to suit Venator's meticulous standards. In front of the inquisitor rested a thick manila folder; a method of record keeping Venator found archaic and inefficient. Even though he had already memorized all the pertinent information inside he made a show of glancing through the papers as he asked, "It says in your file Sergeant that you were born in this sector, is that correct?"<br><br>  Sgt. Marbo nodded slowly and replied evenly, "That's right. On this very planet." There was something very disturbing about his large dark eyes.<br><br>  Venator continued, "How do you enjoy being a marine?"<br><br>  Marbo's response was emotionless and to the point, "It is not for me to enjoy sir. I was created to serve." <br><br>  Venator stared at him for several long seconds, as if trying to peer beyond the words into his very soul. Finally he said, "Would you mind removing your hat please?" Wordlessly Marbo reached up and pulled the black wool cap from his head and placed it in his lap. He answered all questions and requests with the same unattached compliant indifference. Venator noted his baldness in the file.<br><br>  Marbo showed no interest in why he had been asked to take off his hat nor did he make any attempts to put it back on, he simply waited quietly for the inquisitor's next question. When Venator broke the silence all he said was, "Thank you for your time today Sergeant. Hope it wasn't too inconvenient. I'm interviewing the entire detachment this week. Just a routine inquiry from the higher ups regarding... budget issues. You understand." <br><br>  Marbo stood to leave replying, "Of course Inquisitor." <br><br>  As he began to walk away Venator called out to him, "One last thing Sergeant," Marbo slowly turned to face him but said nothing. "I observed your squad on the training grounds yesterday. You drill as hard as any marines I have ever seen. But that strange d√©cor on your armor... shouldn't it match the insignias and colors of your company?"<br>  Again Marbo was utterly unperturbed, "I'm sorry Inquisitor I hope we do not offend you. We do some things differently out here. Those colors represent a prominent genetic line from the region to which many of us have a familial connection. Going back hundreds of years. We received special permission from our company commanders, it is all quite legal I assure you."<br><br>  The inquisitor began shuffling papers about before Marbo finished and didn't look up, instead dismissing him with a curt nod and the words, "Very well thank you again for your time. Please send in the next interviewee on your way out."<br><br>  Marbo padded silently outside the minimalistic make-shift headquarters of the illustrious inquisitor into the cold night air. He motioned the waiting Scout Sergeant in with a gesture of his hand. Far out in the deepest recesses of space a dim psychic whisper could be heard...</p>
