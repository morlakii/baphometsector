		<p>The Wave Serpent rocked hard as Mi'yiel made his way through the cramped troop compartment. <br><br>He was as graceful and fluid in combat as any Eldar, but even his alien equilibrium was struggling to remain upright among the statuesque Wraithguard sentinels locked to either side of the modified compartment.<br> <br>The Ork horde swarming the field outside were throwing everything they had at them as their lone chariot carried them faithfully through the storm, but it was not a pleasant ride. <br><br>Reaching the back wall, Mi'yiel flipped the comm switch and his physiology immediately reacted to another violent shudder from the vehicle, he could smell ozone from the shields, the greenskins were getting closer.<br><br>Leaning into the speaker the Spiritseer spoke, "Hybon, what's the situation out there? I sense Shi'ela's presence stronger now, we must be close. Tell me her position is not yet overrun by those beasts."<br><br>The pilot's response was terse, most of his concentration was focused on evading the impossible hail of gunfire and jinking through treacherously jagged imperial ruins, "up ahead...about 12 clicks", static replaced the pilot's voice as the skimmer suddenly rolled 90 degrees on its axis, even though he tried to compensate, Mi'yiel slid into the side wall a little harder than he liked. <br><br>As they leveled out again, the pilot's voice returned, "It's not looking good out there My...Shi'ela's fate...", before the pilot could finish, Mi'yiel interrupted, "I can feel her, she's out there...alive."<br><br>Not waiting to see if the pilot would respond, Mi'yiel turned to make his way back through the eerily silent troop compartment. <br><br>Before he could make it two steps, he was thrown off his feet and slammed into the back wall, a wave of static rushed through the cabin prickling his hackles as the wave serpent rocked forward as if hit from the back with a massive hammer. <br><br>The world went dark for a single moment but Mi'yiel's sight recovered quickly, bright spots floating in his vision. Before he could blink them away, happy realization lightened his heavy soul.<br> <br>"That was no Ork weapon", Mi'yiel whispered, picking himself off the floor.<br><br>As if to complete his silent thought, the pilot's voice once again spilled into the room, "My! Tanith's serpent just came back online! It appears they weren't destroyed, that last hit was from their shield discharging, it knocked out the beacon at Shi's location but the orks in that area are scattered!"<br><br>"Good", Mi'yiel tried to keep the mirth out of his voice, but the news was the best he'd had in month's, "okay Hybon, take us in...let's get Shi and her wraithguard out of there and fall back to Tanith's position...this territory is lost."<br><br>Clicking the comm off, he turned back towards the silent guardians looming on the flanks. Staring into the dim, the Spiritseer allowed himself a rare smile, now I know these visions of a fifth planet can't be coincidence...  </p>
