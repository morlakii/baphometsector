		<p>White-hot sparks and a guttural Ork shouts shot into the air over the mekboy's workbench, "Graaahh! Watch where yer pointin' dat burna!"
		
		<br><br>"Yah boss, yah," mekboy Rusty rolled his eyes as he continued to work, welding scavenged adamantine plates directly onto the Warboss' tough leathery hide. "You'z lucky boss. When we dragged you'z away from dose 'umies what did all da yellin' and shoutin' about dere croosade, you'z was fallin' to pieces. Bossmek Ol' Lucky noticed yer power klaw arm had fell right off, and dragged it along wit' us. It's good dat Dok Skarbad was able to de-amputate-ify it for ya'z."
		
		<br><br>"Shut yer yappin! Can't you'z just werk wit'out yakkin' off yer boss' earz? Besidez, I would'a been fine chargin' dat 'umie box iffen da boyz hadn't'a gotten in me way. Day wuz all bumblin' about complainin' about bein' on fire, when we had perfektly good tankz to be krumpin'. Iffen dey hadn't been dere, I could'a run right through da flames and torn it ta piecez! And anuvver fing-- GRAAAHH!" Warboss Krall's  rant was cut short as Rusty dropped the ceramite plate, torn wholesale from a mostly-intact space marine rhino, right onto the warboss' chest.
		
		<br><br>"Dere. Now no wunz gonna be able to burn you'z again. Not wit a squig's head thick plate o' dis in da way."
		
		<br><br>------------
		
		<br><br>Two long days later, after the mekboys had finished installing the prometheum powered hydraulics onto Krall's legs. With a resounding KA-THUNK, the three ton cybork stood up sraight, crashing his new Ork-sized battle-tank into the ceiling of the mek-shop. "Waaagh! Dis Mega Armor iz juzt what I needz!" A giddy swing of the new servo-enhanced krumpin' arm crashed through the meks' tools, and punched a hole straight through the walls of the shop, into the adjacent garage.
		
		<br><br>Two ammo runts dropped the tools they were carrying for their mekboys, and gaped at the warboss' happy destruction. "He's... Humungus!" one gasped.
		
		<br><br>The other grot glared at the first, bashing him with a nearby wrench. "Dat's Warboss Humungus to you!"
		
		<br><br> Warboss Humungus, for his part, didn't hear his newly acquired name from the gretchin, as he was far too excited to test out his new wargear on the nearby Blood Angels.</p>
